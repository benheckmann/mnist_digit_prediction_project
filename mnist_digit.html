        <h3 class="expl_headline">About</h3>
         <p class="explanation">
            This interactive model aims to visualize how handwritten digits are classified by a simple neural network. 
            The network was trained using a Python model made from scratch as described in the book 
            <a href="http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/">Neural Networks and Deep Learning</a> by Michael Nielsen and uses no special neural network libraries.
            <br><br>
            It was trained on the <a href="http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/">MNIST set</a> of 60'000 training examples. 
            The forward implementation is done in Javascript, meaning the weights and biases responsible for classifying the digits were imported into the Javascript code.
         </p>
        <h3 class="expl_headline">How it works</h3>
         <p class="explanation">
            After a number is drawn on the canvas, the image is binned into 784 pixels and preprocessed in order to make it more similar to the images that it was trained upon.<br>
            The main aspects of the preprocessing are the centering of the image as well as scaling the stroke width in relation to the size of the drawing.
            Next, the second, otherwise "hidden" layer is computed. The value of each neuron in the second layer is computed as a sum 
            of all of the activations of neurons in the input layer, each of which is weighted accordingly.
            While this intermediate layer is ultimately not necessary, it can drastically improve the performance as opposed to directly connecting the input to the output layer.
            It allows the task of recognizing digits to be broken down into specific transformations, like picking up on straight lines or circular shapes before classifying the input as a whole.
            Lastly, values of the output layer are computed as a function of the second layer. Ideally, the neuron corresponding to the correct digit will have a value of nearly 1, while all others have a value close to 0.
            <br><br>
            This value of the output neuron also shows how "confident" the network is in its guess. 
            However, the network tends often to be very confident, even if it's wrong or if the drawn input does not resemble any digit at all. 
            This is because the cost function that was used to train the network penalizes uncertain outputs, even if, for example the training input is a 7 but also looks a little bit like a 1.
         </p>
        <h3 class="expl_headline">Results</h3>
         <p class="explanation">
            The network scores approximately 96.5% accuracy on the set of 10'000 validation images provided by the MNIST set. 
            In other words, it makes an error on about one digit in 29 (on the validation images). 
            This result was achieved by taking the best of ten runs of training the network, each time starting with a random set of weights and biases. 
            <br><br>
            In my experience, this number is probably closer to 15 when drawing on the canvas. I suspect that when using a computer mouse or trackpad, the image might not have
            some of the characteristics that the network has learnt to recognize in the <i>handwritten</i> training examples.
            <br><br>
            Another reason might be small differences in the style of writing. As all of the training examples are provided by the american <i>National Institute of Standards and Technology</i>, 
            they are likely to use american conventions, such as writing a one as a single horizontal stroke, as opposed to also having a small, left-and-down facing stroke at the top. 
            (Ones using the latter style are thus often missclassified as sevens.)
